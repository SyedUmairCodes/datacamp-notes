# Summarizing Data
Imagine you have a joint playlist on Spotify with your friends. You all add songs for each other to listen to. On some occasions, people add the same song multiple times, that can really disrupt your listening enjoyment, so you go through the playlist and remove duplicate songs.

In data preparation, this is the same as removing duplicates in your dataset. However, it is important to understand what duplicates are in the context of your dataset. In Alteryx Designer, duplicates are removed using the Unique tool, which is found in the preparation tool set.

By removing duplicates, we can enhance the data quality of our overall dataset and improve the accuracy of our analyses. Duplicates can skew or distort any results or insights we eventually deliver, so it is always best to remove them early.

Data aggregation involves summarizing large volumes of data into a simplified, condensed format. This is done using aggregation operators such as counting, averaging, summing, or finding the minimum and maximum values to derive meaningful insights. The key purpose of data aggregation is to reduce complexity and make the data more accessible and understandable for analysis, reporting, or decision-making.

In Alteryx Designer, the Summarize tool will allow us to aggregate our data as we want to. We can choose which columns in our dataset to group the data by and which to aggregate based on the functions available. As well as the basic aggregate operators like sum and count, Alteryx Designer offers operators related to numeric, string, and spatial data. Even financial calculations can be carried out on the data.

## Comment your work
Alteryx Designer has a tool allowing you to document and communicate important information within your workflow. The Comment tool allows the user to add comments and descriptions within the workflow.

With this tool, you can document important information about steps included in the workflow. When sharing files and workflows, the comment tool is a great way for other users to understand what processes have been included and why.
