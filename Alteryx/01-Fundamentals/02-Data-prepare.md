# Data Preparation
Data preparation is a crucial step in data analysis and involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data. This "clean", higher quality data is essential to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis results.

Some tasks we could perform to prepare and clean data include ensuring it's free from missing values, typos, and duplicate entries. It also involves confirming the data is relevant. Finally, ensuring the correct data types are applied to columns and using short, descriptive names for columns and tables is essential.

By preparing data at the outset, you avoid surprises during analysis and work more efficiently, laying the foundation for insightful conclusions and effective decision-making. Alteryx Designer has numerous tools that can help us perform data preparation tasks and they are easily accessible from the preparation tool set.

- The sort tool allows you to sort your data by values of one or more columns in your dataset.
- The sample tool allows you to create a sample of your dataset within the workflow.

## Data Types
Always select the correct data type for each column in our dataset. It can play an important role in any analysis within our workflow and can allow additional calculations to be carried out using the columns. We can also better profile a column when it has the correct data type applied.

- Boolean
- Numeric
- String
- Datetime
- Spatial

## Tasks to perform

**Before Data Preparation**
- Connect to a database or data source.

**During Data Preparation**
- Make sure all columns are of the correct data type.
- Remove Duplicate values.
- Keep relevant data for analysis.

**After Data Preparation**
- Create a graph
- Output data from your workflow.

## Practice 

- Practiced working with the select tool, changing data types of columns and finding average values.
- Practiced sorting data with the sort tool.
- Practiced sorting and organizing data.
