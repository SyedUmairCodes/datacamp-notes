# Introduction to Alteryx
You're appointed as a data analyst at high school, your job involves combining data from different departments for analysis. The data analysis would need to automated and the process should be transparent for the management to see.

The solution for this is using the Alteryx Designer Desktop. Alteryx is a data analytics platform that helps businesses and individuals to help them make sense of their data.

It provides a complete data analytics solution with a user-friendly interface. It is designed to handle large datasets effortlessly and empower users to clean, transform, and analyze data from different sources. It supports various data sources, from databases to social media platforms. It is easy to install and set up on Microsoft operating systems.

Alteryx Designer Desktop stands out for its drag-and-drop design, allowing users to perform data tasks easily and create workflows. This makes it accessible to users with any coding knowledge, from basic to expert level. Essentially, it is "Code free and code friendly!"

## Workflows
The main way of working in Alteryx Designer Desktop involves creating workflows. Think of a workflow like a recipe. Just as a recipe guides you through the steps to bake a cake, a workflow in Alteryx Designer guides you through the steps to process and analyze data. Altering and analyzing data in Alteryx Designer is similar to baking a cake.

## Navigating the Designer
The top bar is called the tool window and hosts all of the different tools available to use. The left pane is the configuration window, where you can configure different aspects about your data or the workflow

The canvas area is where we can use our tools to build a workflow to perform our data tasks. We can add tools here in several ways: drag the tool onto the canvas from the tool palette, right-click on the canvas and select the tool we wish to add, or search for a tool in the search bar and drag it onto the canvas.

Down below the canvas is the result window that shows the results of our workflow when it runs or completes a workflow or any errors that might have occurred as well.


> A workflow is created in the canvas area by dragging and dropping tools from the tool window to canvas and then connecting them in order of the required operation

## Practical

- Practiced how to use Alteryx designer desktop on windows and loaded a CSV dataset into the designer.
- Practiced how to browse data in tables and use the browse and unique tools.
- Practiced selecting and deselecting columns in designer.
